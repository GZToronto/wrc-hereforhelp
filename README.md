Work was conducted in the /wrc-react folder.

As this content is now a bit old, you'll likely need to begin with:

```
cd ./wrc-react &&
npm install --legacy-peer-deps &&
npm run start
```

The bulk of the logic is in the `<DecisionTree />` component, confusingly within `wrc-react/src/components/Choicesv2.js`.

Godspeed, traveller.
